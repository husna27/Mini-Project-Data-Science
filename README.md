# Handwritten Digit Classification

This repository contains a mini Data Science project for handwritten digit classification using the `sklearn.datasets.load_digits` dataset, where various classification algorithms (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and MLPClassifier) are compared using cross-validation.

## Overview

The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix, and hyperparameter optimization to determine the best-performing model for classifying digits (0-9).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided and run the cells to replicate the experiments.
